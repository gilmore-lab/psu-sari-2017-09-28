Data Sharing and Management Snafu in 3 Short Acts.
</div>

## Data sharing 

>- easier than most PIs think
>- improves the reproducibility and robustness of research
>- maximizes benefits of participation in research

## Data sharing...

>- can be accomplished for most types of data with planning and permission
>- increasingly mandatory for funders and journals
>- the responsibility of PIs & institutions
    
## Data hoarding 

- is (sadly) the norm in some fields (e.g., psychology & neuroscience)
- is problematic without *very* good reasons 
- undermines the reproducibility of research
- wastes resources, time, & energy

## Overview

- The reproducibility "crisis" in science
- The "crisis" in psychology
- Challenges to more open data sharing
- Some solutions
- Institutional responsibilities

# The reproducibility "crisis"

## Is there a reproducibility crisis?

>- Yes, a significant crisis
>- Yes, a slight crisis
>- No crisis
>- Don't know

## Reproducibility crisis

- Not just psychology
- "Hard" sciences, too
- Data collection to statistical analysis to reporting to publishing
- Ethical urgency

<div class="notes">
Clearly, the significant or slight crisis in reproducibility extends across scientific domains. 
Indeed, the NPR science reporter Richard Harris in a book published earlier this year said that sloppy biomedical research creates worthless cures, crushes hope, costs billions.
But rather than cast aspersions on other fields, let me own the sins of my own.

But rather than cast aspersions on other fields, let me focus on my own field's deadly sins, as cognitive neuroscientist Chris Chambers put it.
</div>

## The sin of unreliability

<small>([Szucs & Ioannides, 2017](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000797))</small>
</div>

<div class="notes">
As Szucs and Ioannides have shown based on an analysis of more than 10,000 papers in the cognitive neuroscience literature, sample sizes are small, and the probability of false negatives is high, especially for small to medium effect sizes.
</div>

<div class="centered">
> "Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature."

# Challenges to sharing

## [Belmont principles](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html): Beneficence
    
>- Data sharing may pose risk of loss of privacy & confidentiality
>- **But data sharing increases value**

## [Belmont principles](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html): Autonomy

>- Data sharing may pose risk of unintended use of data
>- **So participants should participate in decisionmaking**

## [Belmont principles](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html): Justic
    
- Costs of research participation should be equitable
- **Benefits** of research participation should be equitable

## Sharing data ethically

## *What* data are you collecting?

- Personally identifying or sensitive data?
- What risks does data sharing pose?
- How should data be protected?

## *Where* will you share data?

- Researcher/lab/university server
- Supplemental material linked to journal article
- Data repository

## *Who* will (& should) have access?

- Public
- Community of authorized individuals (researchers)
- Individuals selected by repository
- Individuals selected by data owner

## What have participants been told, approved, understood?

- What data collected, what will be shared
- Who will have access
- Where stored, how accessed
- Purposes of use, types of questions
- Shared for how long

## Statutory, regulatory, or contractual restrictions?

- Students ([FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html))
- Health ([HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html))
- From Federal agencies ([Title 13](https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/privacy_confidentiality/title_13_us_code.html), [Title 26](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26))
- Proprietary data

## Benefits (of sharing) vs. risks

- How useful are data?
- How sensitive are data?
- How likely is it that reidentification could be achieved, and by whom?

## Clarifying risk scenarios

- Reidentification by participants themselves
    - Can be harmful, e.g. if dataset contains uncommunicated health risk information
- Reidentification by insider
- Reidentification by targeted search (nemesis scenario)
- Reidentification by mass matching (dystopian AI scenario)

## Mitigating risk

- Assess disclosure risk
- Modify data
    - Aggregate or censor sensitive variables
    - Aggregate or censor secondary identifying variables
    - Perturb or add noise to variables

## Mitigating risk

- Restricting access
    - Data enclaves (e.g., Census data)
    - Virtual data enclaves

# Sharing *identifiable data*

## Databrary's charge

- Share identifiable data (video & audio recordings, individual metadata)
    - Unaltered to exploit inherent richness for reuse
    
## Databrary's charge

- Share across studies and researchers
    - Not on a study-by-study or PI-by-PI basis
    
## Databrary's charge

- Share *consistently*
    - Same permission structure
    - Same metadata
- Store and serve data securely

## Databrary's solutions

- Share identifiable data *with permission*
    - Template sharing permission language
    - ~~*ad hoc* video/photo releases~~ standard sharing levels

- Open sharing among *authorized researchers*, not public
    - Formal (institution-approved & signed) access agreement

- Laws differ among countries
- Comfort with data sharing varies among institutions
- "Cloud" storage vs. institutionally housed
    - Store data (but not share) data for which no permission has been given?
- Role of repositories
    - "Check" IRB/ethics training status or delegate responsibility to institutions

## My opinion ([Gilmore, Kennedy, & Adolph, 2017](http://psyarxiv.com/kew8u))

- Biggest obstacle to more open sharing is cultural, not technical
- Planning to share easier than *post hoc*
    - **Everyone** should be preparing to share
    - Share what data, share where, for how long, for what purposes?
- Seeking permission to share should be common practice
    - Even if data aren't sensitive and/or plan to de-identify
    - Can't share (easily) if you don't ask
    
## Models for data sharing permission

- Separate consent to participate from permission to share
    - Same protocol, two different forms
    - Two different protocols
- Combine permission to share with consent to participate

# Institutional roles

## Institutions

- (Often) own data, although PIs don't always know it
- Have responsibilities under Federal guidelines to help PIs share data

---

> "Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work under NSF grants. **Grantees are expected to encourage and facilitate such sharing.**"

-- NSF, Dissemination and Sharing of Research Results, <https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp>

## Institutions

- Should partner with PIs 
    - make planning for data sharing part of grant seeking & reporting process
    - ensure **data** & **$** well-managed

## Compliance office/IRB role

>- Data ~~destruction after X years~~ sharing for ~~limited~~ indefinite period
>- Share data in ~~lab website~~ secure repository
>- Seek permission for ~~narrow~~ broad secondary use cases
>- ~~Require~~ Discourage reconsent of minors at age of majority unless data *highly* sensitive
>- Implement consistent treatment of similar data types
>- Encourage use of templates

## Progress toward standard templates

- Databrary permission to share [templates](https://www.databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release.html)
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/conf-language.html) language
- [Open Brain Consent](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [New initiative](https://osf.io/r5ufz/) : Databrary + AERA + ICPSR + QDR + OpenNeuro + ...

# In summary...

## Data sharing 

>- easier than most PIs think
>- improves the reproducibility and robustness of research
>- maximizes benefits of participation in research

## Data sharing

>- increasingly mandatory for funders and journals
>- can be accomplished for most types of data with planning & permission
>- both PI and institutional responsibility
>- upholds scientific ideals
